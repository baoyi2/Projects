This is a school project done by me and my partner. Our project idea was to make an automatic light system in a toilet that turns on and off depending on 
the number of people in the toilet. This helps to save eletricity when there is no one in the toilet so no light source is needed.

The LCD screen displays how many people are currently in the toilet. The counter increases when someone enters the toilet and decreases and someone leaves the toilet
as the resources given are limited, we simulate this environment by using two buttons( in actualy implementation, can use light sensors) to see which direction
are the people going, either going into the toilet or going out of the toilet.
