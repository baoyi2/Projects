This is a school project done with two other team members. The main purpose of this project is to lessen the workload of factory workers by introducing an autonomous
vehicle that can assist them in transporting goods from one place to another. 

The chasis is designed on AutoCAD and 3D printed. The autonomous vehicle consists of several sensors to help itself navigate throughout the warehouse and carry out
its functions. The serial monitor displays instructions on how the user should do and error messages, such as "Obstructed" when there is an object blocking it, and
"Not enough boxes" if the user did not put enough boxes inside the built-in container. The autonomous vehicle gos from one station to another, unloading 
boxes accordingly. It follows a path on the floor, marked by black tape. The IR sensor senses where the black tape is marked and moves along it, stopping only when
it reaches its destination stations. The IR sensor accomplishes this by sending signals to the motor to turn which direction and how quickly. The ultrasound sensors 
are placed in front of the autonomous vehicle to sense its surroundings so it would be safe for the users and it would not bump into anything. The buzzer will also 
sound of the ultrasound senses someone is too close to it.
